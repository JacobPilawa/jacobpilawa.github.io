I am a second year graduate student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) studying the the stellar kinematics and dynamics of nearby galaxies with Chung-Pei Ma. Before moving to the West Coast, I attended [Colgate University](https://observatory.colgate.edu/) in upstate New York where I spent most of my time investigating novel methods of constraining dark matter properties.

Aside from astronomy, I enjoy skateboarding, playing chess, listening to music, and finding a quiet, dark sky.
