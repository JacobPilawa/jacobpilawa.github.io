I am a second year graduate student at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu/) studying the stellar kinematics and dynamics of nearby galaxies with Chung-Pei Ma. Before moving to Berkeley for graduate school, I attended [Colgate University](https://observatory.colgate.edu/) in upstate New York where I spent most of my time investigating novel methods of constraining dark matter's properties. I also spent some time at [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/), working on optical computing and photonic neural networks. 

Outside of astronomy, I enjoy skateboarding, playing chess, listening to music, and finding a dark sky for astrophotography.
