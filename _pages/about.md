Hi everyone! I am a third year graduate student in astrophysics at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://astro.berkeley.edu/). I spend my time weighing supermassive black holes with [Chung-Pei Ma](https://w.astro.berkeley.edu/~cpma/) by measuring the motions of stars in other galaxies. 

Before moving to Berkeley, I attended [Colgate University](https://observatory.colgate.edu/) in upstate New York where I studied novel methods of dark matter detection. I also spent some time at [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/), working on optical computing and photonic neural networks. 

Outside of astronomy, I enjoy playing chess, skateboarding, listening to music (formerly a college radio DJ!), and finding a dark sky for astrophotography.
